# Java Compiler Collection (JCC)

Java Compiler Collection is a set of three Java compilers: Maven, Gradle and Ant. This tool installs them to `%AppData%\JCC\` and later adds them to the user PATH variable, so you can use Maven, Gradle and Ant from any place.

## Installing Java Compiler Collection

Installation is very easy, but you will need some requirements.

### Requirements:

- Java SE Development kit >=8 ([bit.ly/javadevelopmentkit](https://bit.ly/javadevelopmentkit) if you don't have it)
- Microsoft .NET Framework >= 4.0 (To compile and install `addtopath.cs`) and added to PATH. OR Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and install from developer command prompt.
