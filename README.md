# Java Compiler Collection (JCC)

Java Compiler Collection is a set of three Java compilers: Maven, Gradle and Ant. This tool installs them to `%AppData%\JCC\` and later adds them to the user PATH variable, so you can use Maven, Gradle and Ant from any place.

## Why JCC

Before I started with Java Compiler Collection development, I used a lot Gradle and Maven compiler and to a lesser extent, Ant.
The problem I had is that you allways need to download the compilers and copy them to the working directory, a mess.

But there are some tools called 'wrappers' that make this work easy, since they are very portable. However, you'll need to copy them inside every project you want to compile.

So I thought how can I make a tool that makes possible to use those compiler without needing to copy them every time you want to develop a Java application, so I developed JCC.

It installs the three compilers in your computer (exactly at `%AppData%\JCC` folder) and then adds that folders to PATH user environment variable.

Yo install JCC, continue reading this document.
